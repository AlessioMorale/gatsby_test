And here we are 🙂

let's start building my FPD-032 beginning with Plates: bottom, Delta Motor and Top plates.

They are milled from 5mm Polycarbonate (lexan) sheet.

I'm working toward having it working as 3D printer as soon as possible so that i can start to develop the rest of functionalities.

I'm going to use [RC ball joints](http://www.hobbyking.com/hobbyking/store/__13099__M3_Alloy_Ball_Joint_5pcs_bag_.html) and 5mm carbon fiber tubes with a m3 threaded rod epoxy'ed inside.
